# Workshop Overview

The goal of this workshop is to give frontend developers the tools they need to create full stack, data-driven, subscription-based web apps. In order to do that, we are going to make use of a few different service providers.

1. [Heroku](http://google.com) - We are going to use Heroku for hosting our server and database. We have chosen Heroku because we can host our server and Postgres database on the same server.

2. [Vercel](http://google.com) - We are going to use Vercel to host our Next.js frontend.

3. [Auth0](http://google.com) - We are going to use Auth0 as our IAM provider.

4. [Stripe](http://google.com) - For paid accounts
